I thought the code of conduct activity reflects to me the differences in compensation and intent. With Go, it is almost wholly maintained internally by google engineers who are compensated purely for maintaining and/or advancing Golang. Versus with the general code of conduct, it's clear this is meant to bridge engineers with different technical capacities, timezones, ideas, etc. are not all necessarily. 

RE the video - the Sheldon video makes a lot of sense in terms of consesus and the need for small, tightly aligned groups who respect each other's capacity and abiliy. Otherwise stalling is a serious risk. But obviously in real-life alignment is not a priori - which is why agreement over a set of arbitration procedures, discussion methods, and active communication is critical towards the end output.
